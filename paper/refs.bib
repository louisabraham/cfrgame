  abstract  = "In economics, most noncooperative game theory has focused on
               equilibrium in games, especially Nash equilibrium and its
               refinements. The traditional explanation for when and why
               equilibrium arises is that it results from analysis and
               introspection by the players in a situation where the rules of
               the game, the rationality of the players, and the players'
               payoff functions are all common knowledge. Both conceptually and
               empirically, this theory has many problems. In The Theory of
               Learning in Games Drew Fudenberg and David Levine develop an
               alternative explanation that equilibrium arises as the long-run
               outcome of a process in which less than fully rational players
               grope for optimality over time. The models they explore provide
               a foundation for equilibrium theory and suggest useful ways for
               economists to evaluate and modify traditional equilibrium

               converge to the set of correlated equilibria of the game. To
               compute these regret measures, a player needs to know his payoff
               function and the history of play. We also offer a variation

              for both diagonally transfer continuous and better-reply secure
              games. First, we show that employing the concept of diagonal
              transfer continuity in place of better-reply security might be
              advantageous when the existence of a mixed strategy Nash
              equilibrium is concerned. Then, we study equilibrium existence in
              better-reply secure games possessing a payoff secure mixed
              extension. With the aid of an example we show that such games
              need not have mixed strategy Nash equilibria. We provide some
              easily verifiable conditions for the mixed extension of a
              two-person game that is reciprocally upper semicontinuous and

  abstract = "We study the problem of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium
              of continuous-action game without access to gradients. Such game
              access is common in reinforcement learning settings, where the
              environment is typically treated as a black box. To tackle this
              problem, we apply zeroth-order optimization techniques that
              combine smoothed gradient estimators with equilibrium-finding
              dynamics. We model players' strategies using artificial neural
              networks. In particular, we use randomized policy networks to
              model mixed strategies. These take noise in addition to an
              observation as input and can flexibly represent arbitrary
              observation-dependent, continuous-action distributions. Being
              able to model such mixed strategies is crucial for tackling
              continuous-action games that lack pure-strategy equilibria. We
              evaluate the performance of our method using an approximation of
              the Nash convergence metric from game theory, which measures how
              much players can benefit from unilaterally changing their
              strategy. We apply our method to continuous Colonel Blotto games,
              single-item and multi-item auctions, and a visibility game. The
              experiments show that our method can quickly find high-quality
              approximate equilibria. Furthermore, they show that the
              dimensionality of the input noise is crucial for performance. To
              our knowledge, this paper is the first to solve general
              continuous-action games with unrestricted mixed strategies and
              without any gradient information.",

  author    = "Perkins, S and Leslie, D S",
  abstract  = "Downloadable (with restrictions)! Continuous action space games
               are ubiquitous in economics. However, whilst learning dynamics
               in normal form games with finite action sets are now well
               studied, it is not until recently that their continuous action
               space counterparts have been examined. We extend stochastic
               fictitious play to the continuous action space framework. In
               normal form games with finite action sets the limiting behaviour
               of a discrete time learning process is often studied using its
               continuous time counterpart via stochastic approximation. In
               this paper we study stochastic fictitious play in games with
               continuous action spaces using the same method. This requires
               the asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic
               approximation to be extended to Banach spaces. In particular the
               limiting behaviour of stochastic fictitious play is studied
               using the associated smooth best response dynamics on the space
               of finite signed measures. Using this approach, stochastic
               fictitious play is shown to converge to an equilibrium point in
               two-player zero-sum games and a stochastic fictitious play-like
               process is shown to converge to an equilibrium in negative
               definite single population games.",
